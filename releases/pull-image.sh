# Pull a build container image, and keep pulling it when Docker Hub does not
# answer.

#   pull-image.sh <image> [<platform>]      e.g. pull-image.sh i386/debian:bookworm linux/386
#
# Every Linux cross build and the qemu registration start with an image from
# Docker Hub, and a run died in its first seconds on all eight of them at once
# (logs node-patches5): six could not get a token from auth.docker.io in time,
# two were refused with "toomanyrequests" - the unauthenticated pull limit a
# shared runner address runs into. `docker run` pulls once and gives up, so one
# slow minute at Docker Hub cost the whole release.
#
# So the image is pulled here first, and from the first of these that answers:
#
#   1. Docker Hub itself, as named - twice, unless it says the pull limit is
#      reached, when asking again only makes it worse;
#   2. mirror.gcr.io - Google's pull-through cache of Docker Hub, the same
#      images by the same names (library/debian, i386/debian, tonistiigi/binfmt);
#   3. public.ecr.aws/docker/library - the Docker Official Images as Docker
#      publishes them on Amazon ECR Public, for debian; i386/debian is the
#      linux/386 image of the same official debian, so it is pulled from there
#      with that platform.
#
# A mirror's copy is tagged with the name the workflow uses, so the
# `docker run <image>` that follows finds it locally and pulls nothing. Which
# source served it is printed, so the log says where the build's base image
# came from.
#
# PULL_IMAGE_SLEEP sets the seconds between attempts (tests set it to 0).
